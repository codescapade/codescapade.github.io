Hi I'm Juriën, a software / game developer. I’ve been working as a full stack developer for the past 4 years.
In my current role we use C# on the frontend and Python on the backend.

In my spare time I create small games using all kinds of engines and frameworks from [Unity](https://unity.com)
to [Haxeflixel](http://haxeflixel.com). I think I tried them all at this point. At the moment I’m using [Kinc](https://github.com/Kode/Kinc) to try and build my own game engine.

I’m using this site as a portfolio for my games and projects and to blog
about software and game development.  
You can contact me at **codescapade [at] gmail [dot] com**.
