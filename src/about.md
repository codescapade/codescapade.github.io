Hi, I'm Juriën, a software/game developer. I’m a senior software engineer and have been working as a developer since 2017.
In my current role, I work with C# and TypeScript on the front end and Python on the back end.

In my spare time, I create small games using all kinds of engines and frameworks from [Unity](https://unity.com)
to [Haxeflixel](https://haxeflixel.com). I think I tried them all at this point. At the moment I am building my own game engine with WebGL and [Haxe](https://haxe.org).

I’m using this site as a portfolio for my games and projects and to blog
about software and game development.  
You can contact me at **codescapade [at] gmail [dot] com**.
