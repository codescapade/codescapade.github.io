I have been working on small 2d game engines for a few years now in different programming languages. I think I like making engines more than games because I keep starting over. I have been working on Aeons for almost a year. It is written in [Haxe](https://haxe.org) and uses a low-level framework called [Kha](https://github.com/Kode/Kha) as its base. It is very cross-platform, but that comes with a price. Haxe compiles to JavaScript or C++ depending on the release platform and the graphics, input, audio, windowing, etc. backends vary per platform. I don't have the knowledge to fix issues in Kha when something breaks. I can of course make an issue on GitHub and they do get fixed, but I like to know if it is my code or the framework when I have a bug. If I'm making an open-source game engine I want to be able to support it myself for the most part. I might go back to Aeons in the future. I do like what I created, but for now, I'm starting over again.

All of the games I finished in the last couple of years have been small game jam games published on the web. I don't think I'm going to make a game that can go on consoles so do I really need my engine to be that cross-platform? I don't think so. At work I have been using TypeScript a lot lately so I decided to make a game engine in TypeScript. If I do want to make a mobile or desktop game there is [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com) or [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org). So far the performance isn't too bad. It is not like native, but the games I make don't really need that.

I'm calling it Lumi-TS. I don't need a cross-platform framework for this so the only third-party frameworks I'm planning to use so far in the engine are [glMatrix](https://glmatrix.net) for matrix calculations and [box2d.ts](https://github.com/lusito/box2d.ts) for physics if I need it in a game. The engine structure will be very similar to Aeons. Flexible ECS, important parts of the engine globally accessible if needed. I do have to write some more code because TypeScript doesn't have macros like Haxe but so far everything is going pretty smoothly. I think I have about 60% of the functionality that Aeons has completed. At the moment the engine is not open source. I do plan to make it open source in the future when it is more complete and ready to be used by other people. The plan is to post more updates about it here soon.
